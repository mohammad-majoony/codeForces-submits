# Codeforces Submissions

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository contains my solutions to various problems on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).  
I use this repo to organize my submissions, track my progress, and share my coding journey.

## ðŸ“š Structure
- Solutions are organized by contest number or problem code.
- Each folder or file includes:
  - Problem link
  - My solution (code)
  - Sometimes extra notes about tricky parts.

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Improve problem-solving and algorithmic skills.
- Practice competitive programming regularly.
- Share clean and well-commented code for learning and reference.
